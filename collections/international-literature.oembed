Sixteen stories are retained from the third edition, including the \"Pioneers of A.A.\" section, which helps the reader remain linked to A.A.'s historic roots, and shows how early members applied this simple but profound program that helps alcoholics get sober today. Approximately 21 million copies of the first three editions of \"Alcoholics Anonymous\" have been distributed. It is expected that the new fourth edition will play it's part in passing on A.A.'s basic message of recovery. This fourth edition has been approved by the General Service Conference of Alcoholics Anonymous, in the hope that many more may be led toward recovery by reading it's explanation of the A.A. program and it's varied examples of personal experiences which demonstrate that the A.A. program works. This edition is in Spanish.\u003c\/span\u003e","brand":"AA World Service","offers":[{"title":"Hardcover","offer_id":1174832815,"sku":null,"price":14.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Softcover","offer_id":1174832819,"sku":"","price":13.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Pocket Softcover","offer_id":1237701119,"sku":"","price":13.95,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0685\/9435\/products\/spanish-alcoholics-anonymous-alcohlicos-annimos-all-versions-click-for-options.jpg?v=1585854650"}],"url":"https:\/\/www.choicesgifts.com\/collections\/international-literature.oembed","provider":"Choices Books \u0026 Gifts","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
